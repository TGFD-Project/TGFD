<h2 id="1-overview">1. Overview</h2>

The **T**emporal **G**raph **F**unctional **D**ependencies (TGFD) project detects errors in TGFDs. A TGFD is a new class of temporal dependencies over graphs that specify topological and attribute requirements over a time interval.

This page provides supplementary experimental details, dataset characteristics, TGFD samples, and a link to the source code.

<h3 id="21-dbpedia">2.1 DBpedia</h3>

[DBpedia](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/collections/latest-core) is a dataset containing structured content of Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia [1].

This dataset contains 2.2M entities with 73 distinct entity types and 7.4M edges with 584 distinct labels [2].

```

<h4 id="211-dbpedia-tgfds">2.1.1 DBpedia TGFDs</h4>

We manually defined a core set of TGFDs that were curated according to real life domain knowledge. We then used a systematic approach to vary |Q| (adding attribute), expanding delta, and increasing the number of attributes.

```diff
! TODO: expand description of approach of generating TGFDs [2021-03-21] [@adammansfield]
```

We used a subset of the vertices and edges in the DBpedia dataset to form TGFDs.

<h3 id="23-synthetic">2.3 Synthetic</h3>

[gMark](https://github.com/gbagan/gmark) is a synthetic graph data generation tool.

It takes as input a configuration file. The configuration file lists the number of nodes, the node labels and their proportions, the edge labels and their proportions, and a schema that defines the triples in the graph and also the distributions of the in-degrees and out-degrees of each triple. It outputs a synthetic graph that is represented as a list of triples (e.g "Person_123 isLocatedIn City_123").

This script will:
  1. Download IMDB diffs from 1998-10-09 to 2017-12-22.
  2. Reverse patch diffs to generate snapshots in IMDB list txt format.
  3. Process the IMDB lists into a single RDF snapshot per timepoint.
